1. DashBoard : The Dashboard displays a summary of your leave balance, upcoming holidays, and your team's upcoming leaves. It provides a quick view of your leave status and helps track team availability for better planning.

2. When applying for leave, I have implemented validation on both the frontend and backend to ensure that the total leave days are calculated correctly, excluding weekends. The backend API does not accept the total days from the frontend but instead calculates it internally and updates the database accordingly. Additionally, the backend API only returns the leave types specific to male and female employees based on their eligibility.

3.  In the "My Teams" tab, there are two sections:

    I. Leaves Tab: This section displays all approved leave requests. It also includes a "Details" button for viewing more information about each employee's leave request.

    II. Requests Tab: This section contains all pending, cancelled, and rejected leave requests.
